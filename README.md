# Narrative Visualization: Warehouse & Retail Sales Story

This project creates an interactive data story that explores warehouse and retail sales patterns using D3.js visualizations. The narrative guides users through four key insights about sales performance across different product categories, time periods, and distribution channels.

Messaging: The visualization tells a clear story about which product categories perform best in the market. Users discover that certain categories like wine, beer, and liquor have different sales patterns, and the data reveals interesting trends about seasonal performance and channel preferences.

Narrative Structure: I built an interactive slideshow that lets users follow a guided journey through the data. Users can move through four slides at their own pace, with each slide building on the previous one while allowing exploration through dropdown menus and filters.

Visual Structure: The design uses consistent colors and smooth animations to create a professional look. Each slide uses the right type of chart for its story: bar charts for comparisons, line charts for trends over time, and grouped charts for channel analysis.

Scenes: The story unfolds through four main scenes:

Scene 1: Shows the big picture of which product categories sell the most
Scene 2: Reveals how sales change over time with seasonal patterns  
Scene 3: Compares retail versus warehouse sales performance
Scene 4: Identifies the top performing suppliers in the market

Annotations: I added smart callouts that appear after charts load to highlight the most important findings. These annotations point to key data points like market leaders and peak sales periods, helping users understand what matters most in each visualization.

Parameters: Users can interact with the data through dropdown controls that filter information by category, year, or performance metric. These controls let people explore different aspects of the data while keeping the main story intact.

Triggers: The visualization responds to user actions in multiple ways - buttons for navigation, dropdowns for filtering, hover effects for detailed information, and timed animations that reveal insights at the right moments.
